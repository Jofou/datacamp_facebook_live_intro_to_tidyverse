# Introduction to the Tidyverse: Survivors of the Titanic, the Tidy Way
DataCamp Facebook Live Code Along Session 5: Learn how to to use tidy tools in R, such as dplyr and ggplot2, to intuitively explore &amp; analyze your data.

with DataCamp's very own Hugo Bowne-Anderson. Follow him on twitter [@hugobowne](https://twitter.com/hugobowne).

## Description

In this live code-along session, you'll learn the basic principles of analyzing your data using R and the tidyverse. You'll code along with Hugo to explore the Titanic dataset and discover how you can use packages (i.e. sets of tools for doing stuff with data) in the tidyverse to get from data to insight as intuitively and efficiently as possible. But seriously: if you want to filter your data, you use the verb (or function) `filter`; if you wish to arrange it in a particular order, you use `arrange`. The tidyverse set of tools is a revolution that consists of computational tools that intuitively mirror how we all think about data. Be part of the revolution. Join us code along to use these tools to explore the Titanic dataset, which consists of observations of passengers on the infamous ship, many of their characteristics and whether they survived or not.

## Prerequisites

None. I have always found that the most important and beneficial prerequisite is a will to learn new things so if you have this quality, you'll definitely get something out of this code-along session.

Also, if you'd like to watch and **not** code along, you'll also have a great time and these notebooks will be downloadable afterwards also.

## Installation

1. Install R from [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/).
2. Install RStudio from [here](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/).
3. Follow Jenny Bryan's instructions [here](https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/r-setup.html) to test your set-up.
4. Install all the packages in the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) by running `install.packages("tidyverse")` in RStudio.

## Clone the repository

To get set up for this live coding session, clone this repository. You can do so by executing the following in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/datacamp/datacamp_facebook_live_intro_to_tidyverse
```

Alternatively, you can download the zip file of the repository at the top of the main page of the repository. If you prefer not to use git or don't have experience with it, this a good option.
